            <h2>I Am Home</h2>
            <p>Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. In fact, some of them cannot be translated into other languages. In Japanese, certain set phrases almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for instance, saying "Welcome back" ("おかえりなさい" "okaeri nasai") instead of using a more suitable wording such as "I am home" ("ただいま" "Tadaima") when he comes home.</p>

                <img src="pictures/misae.jpg" alt="">
                <p>She is Shin-chan's mother from Kyushu. She is 29 and a typical housewife of post-war Japan: She cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers Shin-chan and his sister, and lazes. She is a tough and strong woman. While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children, she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight. Her famous and symbolic moves includes "drilling" others' head with her fists (known as "guri-guri") and a series of punches on the head, creating comically large lumps (the punches are mainly thrown by Misae, but other characters have been known to use it as well, such as Hiroshi and even Nene).</p>

                <h3>35 Years Old | <span class="name">Salaryman</span></h3>
                <img src="pictures/harry.jpg" alt="">
                <p>He is Shin-chan's father from Akita in Northern Japan, and is the sole source of income. Also known as Harry, he is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take home pay to his wife every month. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath.</p>
